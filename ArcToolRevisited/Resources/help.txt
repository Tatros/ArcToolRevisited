[Installation]

    Just extract ArcToolRevisited.zip to it’s own folder and run ArcToolRevisited.exe.

[Why this program]

    Resident Evil 5 stores most game data in proprietary archive files (*.arc)
    located in your resident evil 5\nativePC\Image\Archive directory. 
    
    This program can unpack the contents of those archive files, 
    allowing you to modify them. Afterwards it allows you to repack the files. 
    Additionally, some tools to convert textures into useful formats are provided.

[Important Stuff]

    When examining extracted files, you might come across files with a ".header" ending.
    Never delete .header files. They are needed to convert your DDS files back
    to TEX. Also never change the filename of a DDS file without also changing
    the name of it’s corresponding .header file.





A short guide on how to accomplish common tasks
================================================

Extraction Tasks
----------------

    Task a): "Extract a single *.arc"

        1) click on “Extract Arc(s)”, 
           navigate to the directory containing the .arc file you want to extract, 
           select the .arc file and click open.

        2) Select the destination directory where the contents should be unpacked to.

    Task b): "Extract multiple *.arc files simultaneously"

        1) click on “Extract Arc(s)”, 
           navigate to the directory containing the .arc file you want to extract, 
           select all .arc files you want and click open.

        2) Select the destination directory where the contents should be unpacked to.

    Task c): "Extract all Resident Evil 5 files"

        1) Click on “Extract RE5”, 
           navigate to your main resident evil 5 directory and select “RE5DX9.EXE” 
           (you can also select “RE5DX10.exe” switch the drop down menu)

        2) Select the destination directory where the contents should be unpacked to.


Extraction Options:
-------------------

    [Checkbox]: "Create a Folder for each Arc"

        When this checkbox is checked, 
        the program will create a new folder with the name of the arc file.
        The folder will be located in the output directory for each selected arc file.
        Also works with complete resident evil 5 extraction.
        
        Checked by default, as you would normally want to keep the folder structure,
        that was specified by the developers.

    [Checkbox]: "Extract textures only"

        When this checkbox is checked,
        the program will only extract the textures (*.tex) from the arc file 
        (while keeping the original folder hierarchy within the arc). 
        Also works with complete resident evil 5 extraction.
        
        Useful when you only want to look at the textures.


Repacking (modified) contents
-----------------------------

    General: You DON’T need to remove .dds or .header files from the directory before repacking. 
             Just unpack, edit and repack.
             The program will automatically handle .dds and .header files for you. 
    
    If you want the program can automatically convert all found .dds files back into .tex.
    You will get a Dialog Box asking you whether any found .dds files should be converted back to .tex. 
    So there’s no need for manual conversion. 
    
    1) Click on “Repack Arc”, navigate to the folder that holds your arc’s contents and click “OK”. 
       For example if you have previously extracted:
       “uPl00ChrisNormal.arc” to “C:\Chris”,
       then select “C:\Chris”.

    2) Select the destination directory where the new arc should be saved to and type a name for the arc. 
       If you enter a filename that already exists in that directory, then that file will be overwritten.

    3) Now you’ll be asked if you want to convert all .dds files that are found in the directory back to tex. 
       If you edited some textures I suggest you click yes. Click save and wait for the repacking process to finish.

Converting *.tex (texture) Files to editable *.dds
--------------------------------------------------

    General: The program will generate .header files. Each DDS file has a corrosponding .header file
             with the same name as the dds. Do not rename or delete those files. 
             They are needed to convert DDS back to TEX.

    Most TEX Files will convert successfully. I tried to convert all RE5 files. 
    Out of about 64000 Files about 750 didn’t convert to DDS. 
    Those are mostly cubemaps, which are currently unsupported.

    1) Click on “TEX to DDS”, 
       navigate to the folder containing the TEX files you want to convert. 
       Select all TEX files that should be converted. Then click “OK”.

    2) Choose an Output Folder and wait for the process to finish.

Converting DDS Files back to TEX
---------------------------------

    1) Click on “DDS to TEX”. You have three options now. 
        
        1. You can manually select the .dds file(s) you want to convert.
        2. or you can convert all *.dds files in a directory (including subdirectories) back to .tex 
        3. You can cancel this task, in which case we are done.

    2) Choose one of the options described in the previous step.

        Option 1) manually select files:
            Just select all .dds files you want to convert and choose an output directory,
            where the program should store the converted .tex files.
        
        Option 2) all Files in a directory:
            Select the root directory from where the program should look for .dds files.
            For example, if you have previously extracted “uPl00ChrisNormal.arc” to
            “C:\Chris” and edited some dds files there, just select “C:\Chris” and
            the program will convert all the .dds files back to .tex (overwriting other
            tex files with the same name). 
            
            Note: Never delete .header files, unless you delete corresponding .dds file as well.

        
Example Use Case
================

    1) Extract uPl00ChrisNormal.arc to a directory of your choice. 
       Textures will automatically be converted to dds. Just don’t delete or rename the .header files. 
       They will be ignored when you repack the archive anyway. So theres no need to move them around.

    2) Edit a .dds file of your choice (e.g. using photoshop and the DDS plugin offered by nvidia). 
       Save as dds in DXT1 or DXT5 depending on what the file was before.
       In general the following seems to be true:
        - files that contain "_BM" are color maps and should be saved as DXT1.
        - files that contain "_MM" are specular maps and should be saved as DXT1.
        - files that contain "_NM" are normal maps and should be saved as DXT5.


    3) When you’re done editing the files, 
       select “Repack Arc” and select the main Folder of the extracted arc
       (e.g. C:\Chris\uPl00ChrisNormal\ or wherever you unpacked the files to). 
       Conversion of .dds files to .tex will be handled automatically for you.

    4) Copy your .arc to the Image\Archive directory, overwriting the original .arc file. 
       Please don't forget to make a backup of the original.
       Done! You can now check your mod ingame.

Note: If you want to convert textures manually then use the corrosponding buttons.
      This is all for now. Happy modding!
